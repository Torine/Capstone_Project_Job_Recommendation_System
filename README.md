### 1. Business Understanding
### 1.1 Objective
The objective of the SmartMatch project is to address inefficiencies in the traditional job search and recruitment process by developing an intelligent job recommendation system. This system is designed to enhance job matching accuracy, improve recruitment efficiency, and streamline the job search experience for both job seekers and recruiters.
### 1.2 Problem Statement
Traditional job search platforms often lead to job seekers struggling to find positions that match their skills and qualifications. Similarly, recruiters are overwhelmed with a large number of applications, many of which are unsuitable. The goal of SmartMatch is to reduce these inefficiencies by offering personalized job recommendations that align closely with the skills, experience, and preferences of job seekers.

### 1.3 Project Goals
Improve job matching accuracy.
Increase recruitment efficiency by providing recruiters with a more targeted pool of candidates.
Enhance user satisfaction and engagement with a personalized job search experience.
Develop a scalable and adaptable system that evolves with market trends.

### 2. Data Understanding
### 2.1 Data Collection
For this project, we utilized several datasets sourced from Kaggle:
Combined_Jobs_Final.csv: Details about job openings, including job ID, title, company, location, industry, job description, and salary.
Experience.csv: Information on job seekers' previous roles, including position name, employer name, job description, and salary.
Job_views.csv: Data tracking the duration job seekers spend viewing job openings.
Positions_Of_Interest.csv: Records job seekers' interests in various positions.
job_data.csv: Further descriptions of job openings, complementing the data in Combined_Jobs_Final.csv.
### 2.2 Data Exploration
We conducted an initial exploration of the datasets to understand the distribution, relationships, and potential issues such as missing values or duplicates. Key insights from this exploration phase guided the subsequent data preparation steps.

### 3. Data Preparation
### 3.1 Data Cleaning
Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate entries across all datasets.
Missing Value Handling: Implemented strategies such as imputation and deletion for handling missing values.
Data Standardization: Ensured consistency in formats, such as date and salary fields.
### 3.2 Feature Engineering
Text Processing: Applied TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to transform job descriptions into numerical features for the recommendation models.
Data Transformation: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding where necessary.
### 3.3 Data Integration
Dataset Merging: Combined various datasets to create a comprehensive profile for both job seekers and job postings, enabling more accurate and personalized job recommendations.

### 4. Modeling
## 4.1 Model Selection
Several machine learning models were evaluated to identify the best approach for job recommendations:
Content-Based Filtering: Used TF-IDF to match job seekers' profiles with job descriptions.
Collaborative Filtering: Analyzed job seekers' behavior to suggest jobs that similar users have viewed or applied for.
### 4.2 Model Training
The selected models were trained using the prepared datasets, with hyperparameter tuning applied to optimize performance.

### 5. Evaluation
### 5.1 Model Performance
### Model 1
Content Based Filtering

Precision:  0.9333333333333332
Recall:  0.35
mrr_value:  1.0
ndcg:  0.5137088609996164.
### Model 2
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Both had a similar score below.

Precision:  0.6
Recall:  1.0
mrr_value:  1.0
ndcg:  1.0
### 5.2 Model Evaluation
Model 1:
Conclusion:
 Highly precise with perfect top ranking, but low recall limits the range of relevant jobs shown.

Insight:
 Ideal for focused, top-quality recommendations; needs better recall and ranking beyond top jobs.

Model 2:
Conclusion: 
Perfect coverage and ranking, but moderate precision includes some less relevant jobs.

Insight:
 Best for comprehensive job listings with perfect ranking; can improve by increasing precision.

### 6. Deployment
### 6.1 Web Application
The SmartMatch system was deployed as a web application using Streamlit. The application features a user-friendly interface where job seekers can input their profiles and receive personalized job recommendations.

### 6.2 Continuous Integration
Regular updates and system maintenance processes were established to ensure the system remains up-to-date and continues to deliver accurate recommendations as user data and market trends evolve.
### 6.3 Monitoring and Feedback
User Feedback Loop: Implemented to continuously improve the system based on user interactions and feedback.
Performance Monitoring: Ongoing tracking of system performance to identify areas for further optimization.
